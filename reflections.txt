> What new skills have you learned?

I have learned basic HTML syntax and some important HTML elements.

Every HTML file conforms a "template" including a head and a body. Elements in HTML are organized through a tree structure. Each individual element has its own content surrounded by tags.

I also learned some specific elements, including headers, paragraphs, links, lists (ordered/unordered), images, figures, and buttons. Also, I have practiced to look up new elements in the reference. 


> What has been easy?

Everything has been easy.


> What has been difficult?

Nothing has been difficult.
